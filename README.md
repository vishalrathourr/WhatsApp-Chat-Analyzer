# WhatsApp Chat Analysis Tool

This Python project allows you to analyze your WhatsApp group or individual chat by uploading a text file exported from WhatsApp. The tool provides various statistics and visualizations to help you understand your chat activity. You can also access these features through the [web application](https://whatsanalysis.streamlit.app/).


## Features

- **Total Messages:** Calculate the total number of messages in the chat.
- **Total Number of Words:** Count the total number of words in the chat.
- **Number of Media Shared:** Determine the number of media files (images, videos, etc.) shared in the chat.
- **Number of Links Shared:** Find out how many web links were shared in the chat.
- **Monthly and Daily Timeline:** Display graphs showing user activity over time, both on a monthly and daily basis.
- **Most Busy Months and Days:** Create bar plots to highlight the most active months and days.
- **Weekly Activity Heatmap:** Generate a heatmap to visualize weekly activity with time.
- **Word Cloud:** Create a word cloud to visualize the most frequently used words in the chat.
- **Bar Plot for Most Used Words:** Display a bar plot of the top 10 most used words in the chat.
- **Top 5 Busy Users:** Identify the top 5 most active users and their message percentage in the group.
- **Emoji Usage DataFrame:** Provide a DataFrame of used emojis in the group with their counts.


## Limitations

- **Date and Time Format**: This tool is designed to work with WhatsApp chat exports in which the date and time format follows this pattern: "dd/mm/yy, hh:mm a " eg. "26/02/23, 5:15â€¯pm". If your chat export uses a different date and time format, the tool may not work as expected.

## Usage

1. Visit the [web application](https://whatsanalysis.streamlit.app/).

2. Upload your WhatsApp chat export text file (typically named `chat.txt`).

3. Select the *"All"* or *"Select any specific user"* and Click on the **Show Analysis** button you're interested in, and the tool will generate the corresponding statistics and visualizations.

4. Now you can see the generated visualizations and reports.
